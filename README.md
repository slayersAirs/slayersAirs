- 👋 Hi, I’m @slayersAirs
- 👀 I’m interested in making cryptomining more accessible to the public who don't have the ability to understand how it works. (Explaining in a way that the deaf community can also understand and have the knowledge readily available)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 🪙bitcoin,🪙 blockchain, 🪙mainnet, 🪙Pi processes and other 🪙crypto currency relations.🪙
- 💞️ I’m looking to 📢🎬collaborate on significantly changing the barrier that's keeping everyone that wants to join a crypto currency trade but is hesitant because they don't know the full extent of the capabilities.
- 📫 How to reach me 🔅🔆Brighterdaysmaidsllc@outlook.com🔆🔅
